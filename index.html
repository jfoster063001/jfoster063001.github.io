          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello! I'm Jackson Foster, and I'm excited to share that I've recently graduated, fulfilling my passion for technology and computer science.
  
              Having completed my academic journey, I proudly received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in December 2023.
               Throughout my time in university, academic excellence has been a cornerstone of my experience. I'm grateful to have
                been nominated to the President's List twice, a testament to my dedication and hard work.
              
              Now, as I embark on the next chapter of my career, I look forward to applying my knowledge and skills in the dynamic field of technology.
  
              Currently, I'm gaining valuable experience at MarksNelson, where I work as an IT Technician. While I enjoy
               my role and the opportunities it brings, my heart is set on becoming a developer. I find software
                development incredibly exciting, and I can't wait to immerse myself fully in this dynamic field.
                 My technical toolkit includes various programming languages like Java, Python, and C++..</p>
